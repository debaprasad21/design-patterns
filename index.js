/**
 *
 * Singleton Pattern
 * Singleton Pattern is a design pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to one object.
 * This is useful when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across the system.
 * The concept is sometimes generalized to systems that operate more efficiently when only one object exists,
 * or that restrict the instantiation to a certain number of objects.
 *
 * Singleton Object is global to application.
 * Hard to refactor.
